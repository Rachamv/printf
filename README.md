## _printf()



The printf project is a collaboration between Oladele Adewunmi and Isaac Adio, students of Software Engineering at ALX. 



This function named "_printf()" imitates the actual "printf()" command located in the stdio.h library of C programming Language. It contains some of the basic features and functions found in the manual 3 of "printf".



_printf() is a function that performs formatted output conversion and print data. Its prototype is the following:



	  int _printf(const char *format, ...) 



Where **format** contains the string that is printed. 



_printf() is a variadic function, it can receives n arguments that replace by n tags written inside the string.



The format tags prototype is the following:



	%[flags][length]specifier

	

If the program runs successfully, the **return value** is the amount of chars printed.
